						<br><span class="pictureFontBody">The goal for this graph is to show each region or country’s amount of waste generated per person versus the total amount for that entire country. We hope to develop it in a way so that when the user hovers a country’s name in the x-axis, that information will be displayed as a bar chart. In addition to that, we want the user to be able to click on either bar so that a new tooltip or window will appear, displaying a further breakdown of the information - the type of waste generated. </span>

The data being shown can be selected from a collection of options at the bottom and will be freely interchangeable to compare various properties. Users should be able to hover their mouse over a country to get the data specific data value of that country under that information type.</span>

						<br><span class="pictureFontBody">For this graph, we were hoping to have the entire world map displayed, and the user would be able to click on whichever country/continent they want to. Once the user does that, the country will be zoomed into the main view, and it will be colored/divided based upon the type of waste in that area. If a user clicks on one of the colored regions, they will get another window to appear that displays the amount of waste that is generated and in which city or state that the waste is in.</span>

						<br><span class="pictureFontBody">Inspired by the XKCD money chart, This chart is meant to show the waste generated in terms of scale from the context of a single household up to the level of countries. The scale starts by displaying the household level waste production and the size of various waste statistics in that level, and incrementally scaling up to the next level by showing how the previous level compares to the full content of the next scale.</span>

						<br><span class="pictureFontBody">The Timeline graph will be focused on displaying the amount of waste generated throughout a period of time, something like 1990 to 2060. The graph will initially begin with a blank canvas, so that once the user hovers over the years on the x-axis, countries or regions will appear (the top 10 highest waste producing countries of that year) as data points. The user can then click on the data points or hover over them to get more in-depth information about the waste generated: the types of waste, income level of the region, the population of that region, etc.</span>
