						<br><span class="pictureFontBody">Chesscubed is an online-multiplayer game of chess extrapolated into the 3rd dimension. It can be played with
						a VR headset (HTC Vive and Oculus Quest tested) in a <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=webxr">WebXR compatible browser</a>. It can also be spectated directly in any modern browser. The game is written in Javascript and is 
						built on the <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a> framework and the underlying <a href="https://threejs.org/">THREE.js</a> library, 
						combined with my prior experience using <a href="https://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> for real-time multiplayer communication.</span>

						<br><span class="pictureFontBody">Particle Sim is a multiplayer sandbox particle simulator. Originally a class project to make something 
						interesting in canvas, I choose to re-create the sand simulators that were popular back in the early to mid 2000s (of which most 
						are gone or deprecated) in HTML5. I later took a class on real time interaction and have been using what I learned about Node.js and Socket.io 
						to rebuild the first project as a real-time multiplayer experience.</span>

						<br><span class="pictureFontBody">This is the result of the original project mentioned in Particle Simulation. 
						This locally run proof of concept effectively demonstrates the system unburdened by network constraints.
						The system works by extracting the ImageData from the current frame and iterating through the pixels.
						Each element is identified by its color and its behavior is used to determine what the next frame will look like. When the frame is 
						built, the image is pushed back to the canvas ImageData object.</span>

						<br><span class="pictureFontBody">Rocket Jump was a team project inspired by the rocket mechanics
						in many first person combat games, the rocket launcher creates explosive projectiles that exert a force on the player. 
						A popular exploit is to jump and fire a rocket at the ground, therefore launching yourself into the air. We decided to
						use this as a mechanic along with an implosion counterpart as the main mechanics for an obstacle course style game.</span>

						by means of the mechanic while challenging preconceived notions about obstacles. This gray box prototype was built using Construct 2.</span>
