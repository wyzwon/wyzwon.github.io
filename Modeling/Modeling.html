						<span style="text-align: left" class="pictureFontTitle">Cover art</span>
						<br><span class="pictureFontBody">The game that a lot of the previous pictures were made for has a dungeon crawler RPG theme, so I set up a dungeon corridor for the box art. 
						The project involved a lot of concepts I have dealt with individually in the past but had never combined in one project (namely lighting, bump mapping, noise maps, fire effects, and UV mapping large structures). 
						After a half hour of rendering with Mentalray, this is perhaps the closest thing to photorealism I have made to date.</span>

						<span style="text-align: left" class="pictureFontTitle">Speed Modeling Competition</span>
						<br><span class="pictureFontBody">The RIT modeling club (RIT Graph) occasionally has speed modeling competitions. One competition was a two hour race to build a scene with the stipulation that it has to
						include the Windows bliss background image somewhere within it. Most people used it as a backdrop for fields and rural settings but I decided to play it super straight and use it as a desktop background.
						 since the competition, I have taken to swapping out the monitor picture with my favorite pictures and using the group of them as a background slideshow. The end result is a desktop that appears to
						 cycle through photos in the midground of my laptops background.</span>

						<span style="text-align: left" class="pictureFontTitle">3D Logo!</span>
						<br><span class="pictureFontBody">I thought it would be cool to build my logo in Maya and rotate it as a gif! 
						The process was reasonably simple for the most part. I modeled Poly Objects and used the boolean function to merge the letters(cleaning geometry as needed). 
						After that I textured the object, made it reflective for a shiny feel, and key-framed it to spin in the course of 36 frames. 
						Lastly I exported the frames as a gif using Photoshop.</span>

						Since our game had "encounter cards" I wanted to make some artwork for them.
						This one was for a ring you could find on the ground. It is one of my favorite examples.</span>
